Welcome to the official GitHub page of TaqaPay! We're thrilled to have you here and are excited to share our journey with you. TaqaPay is dedicated to delivering exceptional digital solutions, and we believe in the power of collaboration and open-source to achieve our goals.

## Our Technology Stack

At TaqaPay, we're leveraging the latest technologies to build seamless and robust applications. Our technology stack includes:

- **Expo**: An open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React. Expo helps us to develop our applications faster and more efficiently, thanks to its wide range of pre-built components and tools.

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types. TypeScript helps us catch errors early through its type-checking feature, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

- **Firebase**: A comprehensive app development platform by Google. Firebase provides us with a variety of tools and services to develop high-quality apps, grow our user base, and earn profits. We use Firebase for its real-time database, authentication services, analytics, and more.
